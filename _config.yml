  summary: "The Pedorthic profession includes the design and manufacture of foot orthoses,
            modification and selection of proper footwear, all aimed to prevent and/or
            alleviate foot problems. We focus on the fabrication and dispensing of orthotic
            devices as well as extra depth footwear and custom shoes. Pedorthists accept
            referrals from Physicians, to dispense orthotics for a myriad of lower extremity
            conditions."
  list:
    - "Bunions (Hallux Abducto Valgus)"
    - "Post operative foot and ankle conditions"
    - "Sesamoiditis"
    - "Plantar Fasciitis and heel spurs"
    - "ACL and Patellofemoral problems"
    - "Neuroma and metatarsalgia"
    - "Congenital deformities"
  orthotics: "The goal of the orthotic is to improve the lower extremity mechanics, by controlling
              the rear foot, mid tarsal joint, and the forefoot. Through controlling the amount and
              timing of pronation, abnormal forces which lead to chronic overuse symptoms can
              be alleviated. Orthotic intervention coupled with proper stretching and strengthening
              lead to tremendous results."
  care: "Taking care of the orthotics and stretching is important for effectiveness and longevity
         of your inserts. The Orthotics are custom made to your feet and will change lower
         extremity mechanics. A gradual break-in period is advised, because orthotics
         change how the foot mechanically works and how your shoes fit.
